Crush a coal to a diamond
Eyes forever shining
Your beauty alone inspire a
niggah to rhyming
Thinking of the betta
things in life
Thinking of how I could
persuade you to become my wife
Hand in hand as we floating
over tropical sands
You my lady I'm ya man
So let's futher advance
to the next scene
Me sleeping next
to you resting
You are the personification
of all God's blessings
Coming to me in
just one physical being
One physical dream that
I wanna redeem Voluptuous
Sweet caramel brown honeydew
Satin skin smooth to the touch
what a niggah do So sensual
Her smile like a chemical
extract of perfection
Rare mineral
She smell like a happy birthday
on a Thursday
Quite time love sleep
in I wake early
Honey brown wit the
long black hair
Teasing me with a
kiss and a stare
Slight touch and you
taking me there
So fine and it just ain't fair
So beautiful and so damn rare
She's angelic and energetic
Using sex as a weapon
I reckon that I'm confessing
Her body is just a blessing
from God Down to earth
She needs to be in a
church to prove that
we didn't spawn form fish
but God's work
hurts to see her clothed
cause her body beholds
Secrets untold valued like
platinum and gold
for she is the key to
open my mind to see
the energy that radiates
from the gates
of heavenly bliss
I reminisce over touch and kiss
While you fuckking a bitch
I go make love to my miss
Never scandalous
It unanimous that the
Hua handled it
Lights off and candle lit
rooms and glamorous
Yo I call you love
sexual you look edible
Parallel snuggle up
close intellectual
In a rendezvous who are
you in wrap hairdo
No makeup in jean shorts
open toe shoe
I wanna hold you mold
ya soul I behold you
Know you better than
myself never own you
But keep you never leave you
I beseech you
Gods gift to man is you
wearing a see through
Riding Seadoos in
Atlantic Ocean
Causing commotion
Lay you down going
through the motions
Keep ya skin soft lotions
got me coasting
Down pretty round brown
thighs the candles low lit
Honey brown wit the
long black hair
Teasing me with a
kiss and a stare
Slight touch and you
taking me there
So fine and it just ain't fair
So beautiful and so damn rare
Look at this agreeable
Delightful
Delectable
Unforgettable
So sweet she may be edible
She needs a pedestal To step out
of heaven you ready boo
Never hypothetical you factual
and magical
Fuck theatrical
Baby girl cause you actual
Physically your chemistry is
so mathematical
Had to use academics to
define your spirit
You lifting my limits
Your name off
my tongue is a lyric
She's a compilation of my
minds representation
Of a representative
Representing an excellen
revelation of time
and dedication
So pure
Never impatient
For real She know the deal
Revealed Herself to me
So I can see Her heavenly wayz
Her heavenly gaze
And plus it don't hurt that
she has an ass for days
Ok
So as we lay I reminisce
on the day that we met
Please god never let me forget
